(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 distrXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)

##############
v 2.2
##############

* created new package to cover Elliptical Symmetric Distributions
  
GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file distrEllipse-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)
