% In order to produce vignette
%
%        "How to generate new distributions in packages distr, distrEx"
%
% from scratch, take care that the /unpacked source/ packages
% distr and distrEx are in one layer of a tree, e.g. ~/Rsrclib/distr,
% ~/Rsrclib/distrEx and that you call R CMD build, check, and INSTALL for 
% package distr in ~/Rsrclib, using the default options. 
%
%
% Specification of a path in file myPATH
% --------------------------------------
% In case you want to use a non-standard building/checking folder (i.e., other 
% than ~/Rsrclib resp. ~/Rsrclib/distr.Rcheck in the example above), or 
% you want to call R CMD from another folder, you may specify a path to 
% your source files in the two-line ASCII file myPATHs to be placed into 
% the source folder ~/Rsrclib/distr/inst/doc; in this two-liner you should 
% give the absolute paths to the source folders for packages distr and distrEx 
% (if these contain spaces, enclose them into ""), e.g. something like
%
% ~/Rsrclib/distr 
% ~/Rsrclib/distrEx 
%
% (in the case described above, this is only necessary if you do not call 
% R CMD from ~/Rsrclib).
