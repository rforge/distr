######################################################################
 

##############
v 1.9
##############

 * made calls to 'uniroot()', 'integrate()', 'optim(ize)()' compliant to 
   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2007-May/045791.html

 * new methods 'shape()' and 'scale()' for class Chisq with ncp=0

 * methods getLow, getUp for upper and lower endpoint of support of DiscreteDistribution or AbscontDistribution
   (truncated to lower/upper TruncQuantile if infinite)

 * added S4-method 'convpow' for convolutional powers from the examples 
   of package 'distr' with methods for
    + 'LatticeDistribution' and 'AbscontDistribution'
    + and particular methods for
          o Norm, Cauchy, Pois, Nbinom, Binom, Dirac,
            and ExpOrGammaOrChisq (if summand 'is' of class Gammad)


 * moved some parts from package 'distrEx' to package 'distr' 
   + generating function 'DiscreteDistribution' 
   + univariate methods of 'liesInSupport()' 
   + classes 'DistrList' and 'UnivariateDistrList'
   + generating functions EuclideanSpace() ,Reals(), Naturals() 

 * 'LatticeDistribution'
   + new class 'Lattice' to formalize an affine linearly generated grid
     of (support) points  pivot + (0:(Length-1)) * width
   + usual accessor/replacement functions to handle slots
   + new class 'LatticeDistribution' as intermediate class between
     'DiscreteDistribution' and all specific discrete distributions from 'stats' 
      package with a particular convolution method using FFT (also for 'convpow')
   + usual accessor function 'lattice' for slot 'lattice'

 * cleaning up the sources
   + adapted the naming of the .R files to the use of the (later written)
     extension packages 
     (and according to http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/06/03/22558.html)
   + checked all source file to adhere to the 80char's-per-line rule

 * revised generating functions/initialize methods according to
       http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/devel/07/01/1976.html
   + in particular all Parameter(-sub-)classes gain a valid prototype

 * new exact arithmetic formulae:
    +   'Cauchy' + 'Cauchy'
       : gives 'Cauchy'
    +   'Weibull' * 'numeric' 
       : gives 'Weibull' resp. 'Dirac' resp 'AbscontDistribution' 
       : acc. to 'numeric' >, =, < 0 
   +   'Logis' * 'numeric'   
       : gives 'Logis' resp. 'Dirac' resp 'AbscontDistribution'
       : acc. to 'numeric' >, =, < 0 
   +   'Logis' + 'numeric'   
       : gives 'Logis'
   +   'Lnorm' * 'numeric'   
       : gives 'Lnorm' resp. 'Dirac' resp 'AbscontDistribution' 
       : acc. to 'numeric' >, =, < 0 
   +   'numeric' / 'Dirac'   
       : gives 'Dirac' resp. error acc. to 'location(Dirac)' ==, != 0
   +   'DiscreteDistribution' * 1 returns the original distribution
   +   'AbscontDistribution' * 1 returns the original distribution
   +   'DiscreteDistribution' + 0 returns the original distribution
   +   'AbscontDistribution' + 0 returns the original distribution

 * enhanced Information:
  + command 'distrARITH()' gains an argument 'library'
  + new file MASKING and corresponding command 'distrMASK()' to describe the 
   intended maskings

 * mentioned in package-help: startup messages may now also be suppressed by
   suppressPackageStartupMessages() (from package 'base')
 
 * formals for slots p,q,d as in package stats to enhance accuracy

    + p(X)(q, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
    + q(X)(p, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
    + d(X)(x, log = FALSE)
    
    used wherever possible;
    but backwards compatibility: 
        always checked whether lowert.tail / log / log.p are formals

 * cleaning up of environment of r,d,p,q-slot  - removed no longer needed objects 
 
 * enhanced plot methods 
   + for both AbscontDistributions & DiscreteDistributions :
     o optional width and height argument for the display (default 16in : 9in)
       -opens a new window for each plot
       -does not work with /Sweave/;
        workaround: argument withSweave=TRUE
        in .Rnw-file: use width and height argument like in 
            <<plotex1,eval=TRUE,fig=TRUE, width=8,height=4.5>>=
             ....
            @   
     o optional main, inner titles and subtitles with main / sub / inner
        - preset strings substituted in both expression and character vectors 
             (x : argument with which plot() was called)
           ~ %A deparsed argument x
           ~ %C class of argument x
           ~ %P comma-separated list of parameter values of slot param of argument x 
           ~ %N comma-separated <name>=<value> - list of parameter values of slot param of argument x
           ~ %D time/date at which plot is/was generated
           ~ %Q comma-separated list of parameter values of slot param of argument x in parenthesis or "" if empty
        - title sizes with cex.main, cex.inner, cex.sub
        - bottom / top margin with bmar, tmar
        - setting of colors with col / col.main / col.inner / col.sub
     o can cope with log-arguments
     o setting of plot symbols with pch / pch.a / pch.u (see ?"plot-methods") 
     o different symbols for unattained / attained one-sided limits   
     o do.points argument as in plot.stepfun()
     o verticals argument as in plot.stepfun()
     o setting of colors with col / col.points / col.vert / col.hor 
     o setting of symbol size with with cex / cex.points 
       (see ?"plot-methods") 

   + for AbscontDistributions 
     o (panel "q"): takes care of finite left/right endpoints of support
     o (panel "q"): optionally takes care of constancy regions (with do.points/verticals)
     o ngrid argument to set the number of grid points 
   + for DiscreteDistributions :
     o using stepfun()

 * left-continuous c.d.f. method (p.l) and 
   right-continuous quantile function (q.r) for DiscreteDistributions

 * new slot 'gaps' (a n x 2 matrix or NULL) for AbscontDistribution
   to cope with intervals where d-slot is 0.
   + new class OptionalMatrix (matrix or NULL)
   + accessor/replacement function gaps()
   + setgaps() to automatically fill gaps-slot

 * Version-management for changed class definitions to AbscontDistribution
   and to (changed by inheriting from LatticeDistribution!) subclasses of
   LatticeDistribution (Geom, Binom, Nbinom, Dirac, Pois, Hyper):
   + moved generics to isOldVersion(), conv2NewVersion() from distrSim to distr
   + moved (slightly generalized version of) isOldVersion() (now for signature "ANY") 
     from distrSim to distr
   + new methods for conv2NewVersion for signature 
     o "ANY" (fills missing slots with corresponding entries from prototype)   
     o "LatticeDistribution": generates a new instance (with slot lattice(!))
        by new(class(object), <list of parameters>)
 * new (internally used) classes AffLinAbscontDistribution, AffLinLatticeDistribution
       and AffLinLatticeDistribution to capture the results of transformations 
                 Y <- a * X0 + b       for a, b numeric and X0 Abscont/Discrete/LatticeDistribution 
   and a class union AffLinDistribution of  AffLinAbscontDistribution and AffLinLatticeDistribution
   to use this for more exact evaluations of functionals in distrEx
 * analytically exact slots d,p (and higher accuracy for q) for distribution objects 
   generated by functions abs, exp, log for classes AbscontDistribution and DiscreteDistribution



DEPRECATED:
*  class GeomParameter --- no longer needed as this the parameter
   of a NBinom with size 1

##############
v 1.8
##############


* Class DExp() introduced (with documentation)
* show() for UnivariateDistribution now is the same as print()
* dim() method for UnivariateDistribution 
* distr (together with distrEx, distrSim, distrTEst) now includes a vignette --- try 
  vignette("distr")

##############
v 1.7
##############


* standardMethods() is again included (with documentation)
* distroptions() / getdistrOption() now behave exactly like options()  / getOption() options --- also compare mail
  "Re: [Rd] How to implement package-specific options?" by Brian Ripley on
  r-devel, Fri 09 Dec 2005 - 11:52:46, see http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/devel/05/12/3408.html
* suggested by M. Maechler: on attaching the package there is a (sort of) 
  warning as to the interpretation of 
    +arithmetics for distributions
  as well as to the
    +accuracy of slots p,d,q filled by means of simulations; 
  these warnings are issued at two places:
      (1) on attaching the package 
      (2) at every show/print of a distribution
      o (2) can be cancelled by switching off a corresponding global option in distroptions() -- see ?distroptions . 
* all specific distributions (those realized as [r|d|p|q]<name> like rnorm in package stats)
  now have valid prototypes
* fixed arguments xlim and ylim for plot(signature("AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution"))
  thus: plot(Cauchy(),xlim=c(-4,4)) gives reasonable result (and plot(Cauchy()) does not)
* Internationalization: use of gettext, gettextf for output
* explicitly implemented is() relations:  R "knows" that
      o an Exponential(lambda) distribution also is a Weibull(shape = 1, scale = 1/lambda) distribution, as well as a Gamma(shape = 1, scale = 1/lambda) distribution
      o a Uniform(0,1) distribution also is a Beta(1,1) distribution
      o a Cauchy(0,1) distribution also is a T(df=1, ncp=0)  distribution
      o a Chisq(df=n, ncp=0) distribution also is a Gamma(shape=n/2, scale=2) distribution
* noncentrality parameter included for Beta, T, F distribution 
* exact +,* for Cauchy and Dirac, for latter also -,/


* "simplifyr": changed default values (using option RtoDPQ.e) 
* masking of function sd from stats to have an additional ... argument 
* masking of function df from stats to have an additional ... argument 

* Internationalization: use of gettext, gettextf in output

* updated citation file

* noncentrality parameter included for Beta, Td, F (for new d,p,q,r, but compatible with 2.2.x)
  also in the documentation

* Geom is now subclass of Nbinom
* virtual superclass ExpOrGammaOrChisq for Chisq,Exp,Gammad
* NEWS file
* commented ARITHMETICS file
* revised help for operators
* new package documentation distr-package.Rd

##############
v 1.6 
##############

Our package is reorganized:
  * distr from now on only comprises distribution classes and methods
  * simulation classes and methods have been moved to the new package distrSim
  * evalation classes and methods have been moved to the new package distrTEst
  * a new class distrEx has been added by Matthias Kohl, providing additional features 
    like distances between distributions, expectation operators etc
  * a new class RandVar has been added by Matthias Kohl, providing conceptual treatment 
    of random variables as measurable mappings

##############
v 1.5 
##############

* package is now using lazy loading
* minor changes in the help pages
* minor enhancements in plot for distributions (Gamma, discrete distributions)
* package now includes a demo - folder; try demo("distr")
* class Gamma has been renamed Gammad to avoid name collisions
* we have a CITATION file now; consider citation("distr")
* enhanced demos:
      + convolution of uniform variables now includes exact expressions
      + min/ max of two variables now available for discrete distributions
* rd-Files have now a keyword entry for distribution and thus may be found by the search engine
* exact formula for "Unif" o "numeric" where o \in { +,-,*,/ }

##############
v 1.4 
##############

* to avoid name collisions with short forms for TRUE and FALSE: classes T and F (T- and F-distributions) renamed to Td and Fd
* package is now loaded as a binary => considerable speed gain
* using subsititute the bodies of the r,d,p,q-function-slots distributions show the parameter values with which they were generated
* convolutions and applications of the math group may now be traced in r-slot of a distribution object, compare
       r(sin(Norm()) + cos(Unif() * 3 + 2))
* parameters of a distribution (mean, sd, etc) are now tested on length 1
    + we see the objects as implementations of univaritate distributions, so vectors make no sense here; 
      rather one could gather several objects with possibly different parameters to a vector of distributions. 
      Of course, the original functions rnorm etc remain unchanged and still allow for vector-valued parameters.
* Classes "Parameter", "Distribution" , "UnivariateDistribution" are no longer VIRTUAL
* "AbscontParameter" and "DiscreteParameter" are replaced by "Parameter"
* type of slots d, p, q and param changed to "OptionalFunction" and "OptionalParameter", respectively
 
##############
v 1.3 
##############

* changes in the Help-File to pass Rcmd check

##############
v 1.1 
##############

* implementation of further exact convolution formulae for distributions Nbinom, Gamma, Exp, Chisq
* exact formulae for scale transformations for the distributions Gamma, Exp
* slot "seed" in simulation classes is now controlled and set via the setRNG package by Paul Gilbert
