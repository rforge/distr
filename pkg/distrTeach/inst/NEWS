#  News: to package distrTeach
######################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 distrXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)
 
##############
v 2.3
##############

No extra changes this time
+ DESCRIPTION files and package-help files gain a tag 
  SVNRevision to be filled by get[All]RevNr.R from utils in distr

##############
v 2.2
##############

user-visible CHANGES:
+ included options("device.ask.default"=FALSE) in demos to avoid the need to press 
  a button between frames in the "movie"

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file distrTeach-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)


##############
v 2.1
##############

* Rd-style:
  + several buglets detected with the fuzzier checking mechanism
    cf [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25) 
       [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe? , Prof Brian Ripley,

##############
v 2.0.3
##############
  
  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled
       by option("newDevice") )
     + after JMC's changes: gone through setIs relations to ensure 
       "correct" inheritance
  * moved license to LGPL-3
  * thanks to a hint by Anja Hueller, discovered a buglet in the demos of distrTeach;


##############
v 2.0 
##############

* created new package 'distrTeach' (version to be consistent with distrXXX family)

* moved teaching functions 'illustrateLLN()', 'illustrateCLT[.tcl]'
  from package 'distrEx' to this new package
