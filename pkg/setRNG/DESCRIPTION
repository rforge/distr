Title: Set (Normal) Random Number Generator and Seed
Description: SetRNG provides utilities to help set and record the setting of
	the seed and the uniform and normal generators used when a random
	experiment is run. The utilities can be used in other functions 
	that do random experiments to simplify recording and/or setting all the 
	necessary information for reproducibility.
