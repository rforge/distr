#  News: to package distrSim 
######################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 distrXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)

##############
v 2.6
##############

user-visible CHANGES:
+ title changed to title style / capitalization

##############
v 2.5
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:
+ cleaned DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE file as to Imports/Depends

under the hood:
+ added .Rbuildignore
+ enhanced imports in DESCRIPTION by explicating second order imports

BUGFIXES:
+ moved generics to "distribution" and "samplesize" to pkg distr to avoid 
   conflict with pkg distrMod

##############
v 2.4
##############

under the hood:
+ removed lazyload tag in DESCRIPTION
+ fixed request by B.Ripley as to installed.packages in branch 2.4
+ deleted no longer needed chm folders

##############
v 2.3
##############

No extra changes this time

+ DESCRIPTION files and package-help files gain a tag 
  SVNRevision to be filled by get[All]RevNr.R from utils in distr

##############
v 2.2
##############

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file distrSim-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)

##############
v 2.1
##############

* Rd-style:
  + several buglets detected with the fuzzier checking mechanism
    cf [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25) 
       [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe? , Prof Brian Ripley,
  + new error/warning-free checking versions (under R-2.9.0 r46589) for distrXXX family;

+ S4 issues:
  JMC has changed the way matrices and arrays are treated as S4 classes

+ plotting
  modified plot methods to better digest "..." (argument "add" is TRUE by default now)

##############
v 2.0.3
##############
  
  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled
       by option("newDevice") )
     + some fix in order to cover the case of argument panel.first=grid()
       in the ... argument (needs a delayed evaluation...)
     + after JMC's changes: gone through setIs relations to ensure 
       "correct" inheritance
  * moved license to LGPL-3


##############
v 2.0
##############

* new class SeqDataFrames to bundle data frames with same column structure
  (e.g. several runs of an experiment); behaves just as an ordinary 3dim
  array but may have varying first dimensions (=sample sizes) and
  varying data types for the columns.

##############
v 1.9 
##############

* adapted the naming of the .R files to the use of the (later written)
  extension packages 
  (and according to http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/06/03/22558.html)
* checked all source file to adhere to the 80char's-per-line rule
* mentioned in package-help: startup messages may now also be suppressed by
  suppressPackageStartupMessages() (from package 'base')
* Version-management 
   + moved generics to isOldVersion(), conv2NewVersion() from distrSim to distr
   + replaced isOldVersion() method for signature "Dataclass" by method
     for signature "ANY" from distr

##############
v 1.8
##############

* plot, print and summary are now more flexible for objects of class Dataclass or descendants
* global conrols by new distrSimoptions()
* now suggests distrEx in description
* new classes ArrayorNULLorVector, MatrixorNULLorVector
* updated citation file
* generic savedata now has a ... argument
***********************
*****  ATTENTION  *****
***********************
From version 1.8 of this package on, we have changed the 
format how data / simulations are stored:
In order to be able to cope with multivariate distributions, 
regression distributions and (later) time series distributions, 
we have switched to the common array format: 
 
samplesize x obsDim x runs; 

for saved objects from earlier versions, we provide the functions
isOldVersion and conv2NewVersion to check whether the object was 
generated by an older version of this package and to convert 
such an object to the new format, respectively.  
* in particular: new slots version, obsDim, and name for class 
  Dataclass and subclasses

##############
v 1.7
##############

* setRNG Namespace imported  
* updated citation file
* NEWS file
* distrSim-package.Rd file

##############
v 1.6
##############

* the signature of simulate has been changed in order to stay compatible with the generic simulate from package stats
  the user should not notice any difference
