#  News: to package distrTEst 
######################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 distrXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)

##############
v 2.8
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

plot methods now return an S3 object of class \code{c("plotInfo","DiagnInfo")}, i.e., a list containing the 
information needed to produce the respective plot, which at a later stage could be used by different graphic engines (like, e.g. 
\code{ggplot}) to produce the plot in a different framework. A more detailed description will follow in a subsequent version.

##############

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)

##############

  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled

       "correct" inheritance

  suppressPackageStartupMessages() (from package 'base')

* slot call.ev in Evaluation class now of class "CallorNULL"
* new slot Data of class Dataclass, but which in turn, in case of simulations,
  has an empty "Data"-slot (to be able to check whether all Data sets of an
  Evaluation List coincide)
* new class EvaluationList with slots name ("character") and Elist ("list") 
  to gather the results of several Evaluations on the same data set
* revised plot method  for class Evaluation to account for multivariate results
* print,plot,summary,show methods for EvaluationList 
* Data as an accessor to slot Data for Evaluation class and 
  to the common Data slot of EvaluationList class
