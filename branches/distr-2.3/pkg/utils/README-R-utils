### finde.R :
#
# searches for a given pattern (possibly with regular expressions)
# in all files with a given file extension in a given folder
# similarly replaces patterns
# Syntax

finde(x = "nchar", dir="C:/rtest/distrEx/R", ext = "R", rec = FALSE)
## args: x : pattern; dir: folder; ext: file extension, rec: recursive in subfolders?

ersetze(x0 = "nchar", x1="nchar", dir="C:/rtest/distr/pkg/distr/R", ext = "R", rec = FALSE)
## args: x0 : pattern to be replaced; x1= replacing text; dir: folder; 
##       ext: file extension, rec: recursive in subfolders?

### ladealles.R
#
# sources in all .R - files from a given folder
# Syntax

ladeall(DIR="distr", develDir = "C:/rtest", pattern = "")
## args: DIR :     relative path to folder starting from develDir
##       develDir: development folder (absolute path)
##       pattern:  regexpr. for files to be sourced in

### compare.R :
#
# compares (recursively over all slots / list elements)
# two objects, i.e. it prints the corresponding slots of object1
# directly on top of the corresponding slots of object2
# Syntax

compare(obj1, obj2, level = 0)
## obj1,obj2: objects to compare; level: used internally for indentation

### setNewEmail.R

# automatically changes an e-mail adress in all (Text)-
# package files: (with extension .R, .Rd, .Html, .htm, .TeX, .Rnw)
# and in corresponding HTML-folders as well as in the DESCRIPTION files
