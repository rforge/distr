notes, warnings:
R-3.0.0dev:  obtain note
Possibly mis-spelled fields in DESCRIPTION:
  'SVNRevision'
... do not know why?


In R-2.15.2pat, we obtain the following warning in distr:
* checking foreign function calls ... WARNING
Foreign function calls with 'PACKAGE' argument in a base package:
  .C("pkolmogorov2x", ..., PACKAGE = "stats")
  .C("pkstwo", ..., PACKAGE = "stats")
Packages should not make .C/.Call/.Fortran calls to base packages. They
are not part of the API, for use only by R itself and subject to change
without notice.

We are aware of it and know that it is related to NEWS entry

"
‘R CMD check’ now checks for ‘.C()’, ‘.Call()’, ‘.External()’ and
‘.Fortran()’ calls in other packages, and gives a warning on those 
found from R itself (which are not part of the API and change 
without notice: many will changed for R 3.0.0).
"

Oct, 09 2012 we contacted Brian Ripley in this issue:

>Up to now, in package distr, in our function qqbounds, we
>used pkg stats C-functions pkolmogorov2x, pkstwo to construct
>simultaneous confidence bands for our distr-S4-methods for
>qqplot (code to call pkolmogorov2x, pkstwo taken from
>ks.test from pkg stats and mentioned so in our Rd's since
>~ 3yrs).

[ We cannot use the API return value of ks.test in this case, as 
  we have to be able to evaluate pkolmogorov2x, pkstwo at 
  arbitrary input values not just at the ks.test statistics. ]

>We did notice that just recently you/R-core switched from
>using .C to .Call in R-devel and from pkolmogorov2x, pkstwo
>to C_pKS2, C_pKolmogorov2x .

>Hence, in our devel versions, we now have a corresponding
>if-switch according to (getRversion()<"2.16.0") for
>defining the interface.

>Still, according to the changes in R CMD check mentioned
>above our code will nevertheless produce warnings and hence
>get problems on CRAN.

>Could you/R-core please help us avoid this, providing us
>with API-function wrappers for C_pKS2, C_pKolmogorov2x
>then?

This is perhaps not necessary; and, in R-3.0.0dev we
no longer get any warnings on this, anyway.
